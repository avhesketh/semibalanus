	abstract = {Temperature is among the main structuring agents on rocky intertidal shores. Although infrequent mortality events associated with high temperatures have been observed in several intertidal taxa, careful documentation of these events is rare, and small-scale variability in mortality patterns remains poorly understood. In Bodega Bay, California, USA, 2 mortality events occurred on exposed rocky shores during the spring of 2004 when low tides occurred around mid-day. Limpets Lottia scabra were killed during unseasonably warm weather in mid-March. In late April, recordhigh temperatures resulted in widespread mortality of the mussel Mytilus californianus. Levels of mortality for both species were closely associated with small-scale variability in temperature, which in turn was closely associated with substratum orientation. Invertebrates occupying surfaces facing the sun when stress was most intense were much more likely to die than those living on surfaces angled ≥ 45° away. Because the within-day timing of thermal stress varied seasonally, the highest mortalities were recorded on southwest-facing surfaces on the March afternoon low tide and on southeast-facing surfaces on the April morning low tide. Limpets and mussels showed little mortality during the events that were harmful to the other taxon, suggesting that these different taxa respond to different aspects of their thermal environment. If climate change results in more frequent and more severe episodes of thermal stress, future ecological change may also be heavily dependent on tidal dynamics and small-scale variation in substrate orientation.},

However, we do not fully understand how changing interspecific relationships contribute to community-and ecosystem-level responses to environmental forcing. I used experiments and spatial and temporal comparisons to demonstrate that warming substantially reduces predator-free space on rocky shores. The vertical extent of mussel beds decreased by 51\% in 52 years, and reproductive populations of mussels disappeared at several sites. Prey species were able to occupy a hot, extralimital site if predation pressure was experimentally reduced, and local species richness more than doubled as a result.

	abstract = {We explicitly quantiﬁed spatial and temporal patterns in the body temperature of an ecologically important species of intertidal invertebrate, the mussel Mytilus californianus, along the majority of its latitudinal range from Washington to southern California, USA. Using long-term (ﬁve years), high-frequency temperature records recorded at multiple sites, we tested the hypothesis that local ‘‘modifying factors’’ such as the timing of low tide in summer can lead to large-scale geographic mosaics of body temperature. Our results show that patterns of body temperature during aerial exposure at low tide vary in physiologically meaningful and often counterintuitive ways over large sections of this species’ geographic range. We evaluated the spatial correlations among sites to explore how body temperatures change along the latitudinal gradient, and these analyses show that ‘‘hot spots’’ and ‘‘cold spots’’ exist where temperatures are hotter or colder than expected based on latitude. We identiﬁed four major hot spots and four cold spots along the entire geographic gradient with at least one hot spot and one cold spot in each of the three regions examined (Washington–Oregon, Central California, and Southern California). Temporal autocorrelation analysis of year-to-year consistency and temporal predictability in the mussel body temperatures revealed that southern animals experience higher levels of predictability in thermal signals than northern animals. We also explored the role of wave splash at a subset of sites and found that, while average daily temperature extremes varied between sites with different levels of wave splash, yearly extreme temperatures were often similar, as were patterns of predictability. Our results suggest that regional patterns of tidal regime and local pattern of wave splash can overwhelm those of large-scale climate in driving patterns of body temperature, leading to complex thermal mosaics of temperature rather than simple latitudinal gradients. A narrow focus on population changes only at range margins may overlook climatically forced local extinctions and other population changes at sites well within a species range. Our results emphasize the importance of quantitatively examining biogeographic patterns in environmental variables at scales relevant to organisms, and in forecasting the impacts of changes in climate across species ranges.},

	abstract = {Ecological studies often focus on average effects of environmental factors, but ecological dynamics may depend as much upon environmental extremes. Ecology would therefore benefit from the ability to predict the frequency and severity of extreme environmental events. Some extreme events (e.g., earthquakes) are simple events: either they happen or they don't, and they are generally difficult to predict. In contrast, extreme ecological events are often compound events, resulting from the chance coincidence of run-of-the-mill factors. Here we present an environmental bootstrap method for resampling short-term environmental data (rolling the environmental dice) to calculate an ensemble of hypothetical time series that embodies how the physical environment could potentially play out differently. We use this ensemble in conjunction with mechanistic models of physiological processes to analyze the biological consequences of environmental extremes. Our resampling method provides details of these consequences that would be difficult to obtain otherwise, and our methodology can be applied to a wide variety of ecological systems. Here, we apply this approach to calculate return times for extreme hydrodynamic and thermal events on intertidal rocky shores. Our results demonstrate that the co-occurrence of normal events can indeed lead to environmental extremes, and that these extremes can cause disturbance. For example, the limpet Lottia gigantea and the mussel Mytilus californianus are co-dòminant competitors for space on wave-swept rocky shores, but their response to extreme environmental events differ. Limpet mortality can vary drastically through time. Average yearly maximum body temperature of L. gigantea on horizontal surfaces is low, sufficient to kill fewer than 5\% of individuals, but on rare occasions environmental factors align by chance to induce temperatures sufficient to kill {\textgreater}99\% of limpets. In contrast, mussels do not exhibit large temporal variation in the physical disturbance caused by breaking waves, and this difference in the pattern of disturbance may have ecological consequences for these competing species. The effect of environmental extremes is under added scrutiny as the frequency of extreme events increases in response to anthropogenically forced climate change. Our method can be used to discriminate between chance events and those caused by long-term shifts in climate.

While field observations on the ecological consequences of heat waves are emerging, experimental evidence is rare, and lacking at the community level. Using a novel “near-natural” outdoor mesocosms approach, this study tested whether marine summer heat waves have detrimental consequences for macrofauna of a temperate coastal community, and whether sequential heat waves provoke an increase or decrease of sensitivity to thermal stress. Three treatments were applied, defined and characterized through a statistical analysis of 15 years of temperature records from the experimental site: (1) no heat wave, (2) two heat waves in June and July followed by a summer heat wave in August and (3) the summer heat wave only. Overall, 50\% of the species showed positive, negative or positive/negative responses in either abundance and/or biomass. We highlight four possible ways in which single species responded to either three subsequent heat waves or one summer heat wave: (1) absence of a response (tolerance, 50\% of species), (2) negative accumulative effects by three subsequent heat waves (tellinid bivalve), (3) buffering by proceeding heat waves due to acclimation and/or shifts in phenology (spionid polychaete) and (4) an accumulative positive effect by subsequent heat waves (amphipod). The differential responses to single or sequential heat waves at the species level entailed shifts at the community level. Community-level differences between single and triple heat waves were more pronounced than those between regimes with vs. without heat waves. Detritivory was reduced by the single heat wave while suspension feeding was less common in the triple heat wave regime. Critical extreme events occur already today and will occur more frequently in a changing climate, thus, leading to detrimental impacts on coastal marine systems.},

	abstract = {Extreme events, such as heat waves, are predicted to increase in frequency, duration, and severity as a consequence of climate change. However, global change research generally focuses on increases in mean temperatures and fails to address the potential impacts of increasingly severe heat waves. In addition, climate change may interact with another primary threat to biodiversity, non-native species invasions. We assessed the impacts of a short-term heat wave on the marine epibenthic fouling community of Bodega Harbor, California, USA, by exposing experimental mesocosms to a simulated heat wave in the laboratory and then monitoring community development in the field. We hypothesized that (1) juveniles would be more susceptible to heat waves than adults, (2) native species would be more susceptible than non-native species, and (3) non-native species would recover more quickly than native species. We observed no effect of the heat wave on juvenile species richness, either initially or during the recovery period, relative to communities at ambient seawater temperatures. In contrast, total adult species richness initially declined in response to the heat wave. Adult community composition also changed in heat-wave treatments, with non-natives representing the majority of species and occupying more cover than native species. The reduction in native richness associated with the heat wave persisted through the recovery period, whereas invasive richness was actually higher on heat-wave versus ambient plates at 95 days. Heat waves have the potential to alter the composition of this community because of species-, taxon-, and/or origin-specific responses; for example, non-native bryozoans displayed greater resistance than native and non-native tunicates. Recovery from the heat wave occurred via growth of resistant individuals and larval recruitment. Our study highlights the importance of considering species’ and community responses to heat waves, and not just mean predicted temperature increases, to evaluate the consequences of climate change.},

These present threats to biodiversity, as they promote population declines and local species extinctions. This implies that ecological communities will need to rely more strongly on recovery processes, such as recolonization from a metacommunity context. It is poorly understood how differences in extreme event intensity change the outcome of subsequent community reassembly and if such extremes modify the biotic environment in ways that would prevent the successful re-establishment of lost species. We studied replicated aquatic communities consisting of algae and herbivorous rotifers in a design that involved a control and two different heat wave intensity treatments (29°C and 39°C). Animal species that suffered heat-induced extinction were subsequently re-introduced at the same time and density, in each of the two treatments. The 39°C treatment led to community closure in all replicates, meaning that a previously successful herbivore species could not re-establish itself in the postheat wave community. In contrast, such closure never occurred after a 29°C event. Heat wave intensity determined the number of herbivore extinctions and strongly affected algal relative abundances. Re-introduced herbivore species were thus confronted with signiﬁcantly different food environments. This ecological legacy generated by heat wave intensity led to differences in the failure or success of herbivore species re-introductions. Reassembly was signiﬁcantly more variable, and hence less predictable, after an extreme heat wave, and was more canalized after a moderate one. Our results pertain to relatively simple communities, but they suggest that ecological legacies introduced by extremely high-temperature events may change subsequent ecological recovery and even prevent the successful re-establishment of lost species. Knowing the processes promoting and preventing ecological recovery is crucial to the success of species re-introduction programs and to our ability to restore ecosystems damaged by environmental extremes.},

	abstract = {Climate change is particularly apparent in many mountainous regions, with warming rates of more than twice the global average being reported for the European Alps. As a result, the probability of climate extremes has increased and is expected to rise further. In an earlier study, we looked into immediate impacts of experimentally imposed heat waves in alpine grassland, and found that these systems were able to cope with heat as long as enough water was available. However, concomitant drought led to increased stress, and reduced aboveground biomass production and green plant cover. Here, we studied the legacy effects (lag-effects) of the imposed climate extreme to see whether delayed responses occurred and how fast the alpine grassland could rebound from the initial changes. Green cover continued to be suppressed the two following years in communities that had been exposed to the most intense hot drought, while aboveground biomass production had returned to control levels by year 2. The initial lower resistance of the forb fraction in the communities was not compensated by faster recovery later on. This resulted in alpine communities that became (and remained) relatively enriched with graminoids, which resisted the original extreme better. The responses of alpine grassland to heat extremes with or without drought observed in this study resemble those typically found in lowland grassland in the short term. However, alpine grassland exhibited longer legacy effects from an annual perspective, with delayed recovery of aboveground production and persistent changes in community composition. This suggests that once initial resistance thresholds are exceeded, impacts may be longer-lasting in alpine grassland, where recovery is constrained by both the short growing season and difficult seedling establishment.},

            Heatwaves have increased in intensity, frequency and duration, with these trends projected to worsen under enhanced global warming. Understanding regional heatwave trends has critical implications for the biophysical and human systems they impact. Until now a comprehensive assessment of regional observed changes was hindered by the range of metrics employed, underpinning datasets, and time periods examined. Here, using the Berkeley Earth temperature dataset and key heatwave metrics, we systematically examine regional and global observed heatwave trends. In almost all regions, heatwave frequency demonstrates the most rapid and significant change. A measure of cumulative heat shows significant increases almost everywhere since the 1950s, mainly driven by heatwave days. Trends in heatwave frequency, duration and cumulative heat have accelerated since the 1950s, and due to the high influence of variability we recommend regional trends are assessed over multiple decades. Our results provide comparable regional observed heatwave trends, on spatial and temporal scales necessary for understanding impacts.},

In most cases, details of how physical conditions within facilitative habitats respond to external climate forcing remain unknown, hampering climate change predictions for many of the world’s species. Using intertidal mussel beds as a model system, we characterize relationships among external climate conditions and within-microhabitat heat and desiccation conditions. We use these data, along with physiological tolerances of two common inhabitant taxa (the isopod Cirolana harfordi and the porcelain crab Petrolisthes cinctipes), to examine the magnitude of climate risk inside and outside biogenic habitat, applying an empirically derived model of evaporation to simulate mortality risk under a high-emissions climate-warming scenario. We found that biogenic microhabitat conditions responded so weakly to external climate parameters that mortality risk was largely unaffected by climate warming. In contrast, outside the biogenic habitat, desiccation drove substantial mortality in both species, even at temperatures 4.4–8.6°C below their hydrated thermal tolerances. These findings emphasize the importance of warming-exacerbated desiccation to climate-change risk and the role of biogenic habitats in buffering this less-appreciated stressor. Our results suggest that, when biogenic habitats remain intact, climate warming may have weak direct effects on organisms within them. Instead, risk to such taxa is likely to be indirect and tightly coupled with the fate of habitat-forming populations. Conserving and restoring biogenic habitats that offer climate refugia could therefore be crucial to supporting biodiversity in the face of climate warming.},

	abstract = {Individual traits and population parameters can be used as proxies of processes taking place within a range of scales, thus improving the way we can evaluate species response to environmental variability. In intertidal rocky shores, patterns at the within-site scale, i.e., between centimeters to hundreds of meters, are important for understanding the population response into these highly variable environments. Here, we studied a rocky-shore mussel population at the within-site spatial scale (1) to test how intertidal height and orientation of the shore affect individual traits and population parameters, (2) to infer the link between individual and population level features, and (3) to explore the upscaling mechanisms driving population structure and processes. We analyzed the patterns of six population parameters: density, biomass, crowding, median individual size, recruitment and mortality rate, and four individual traits: growth rate, spawning phenology, size and condition index. Crowding was defined as the degree of overlapping of individuals within a given area, for which we created a “crowding index”. Mussels were studied along the intertidal height gradient in two rocky shores with contrasted orientation at one site over a full year. Our results showed a significant effect of intertidal height and shore orientation on most of individual traits and population parameters studied. In contrast, biomass contained in a full covered surface did not vary in space nor in time. This pattern likely results from relatively constant crowding and a trade-off between median individuals’ size and density. We hypothesize that growth, mortality and recruitment rates may all play roles in the stability of the crowding structure of mussel aggregations. Variation in spawning phenology between the two shores in the study site was also observed, suggesting different temporal dynamics of microclimate conditions. Interestingly, despite the different population size distribution between the two shores, our estimates indicate similar potential reproductive output. We hypothesize that the structure of the patches would tend to maintain or carry a maximum of biomass due to trade-offs between density and size while maintaining and maximizing the reproductive output. The patterns of spatial variability of individual traits and population parameters in our study site suggest that heterogeneous within-site conditions influence variation in individual performance and population processes. These results provide insights about the relationship between individual traits and how these relationships make patterns at the population level emerge. They provide baseline information necessary to improve models of metapopulation with spatially explicit processes.},

	abstract = {Predicting the effects of rising temperature entails measuring both habitat thermal characteristics and the physiological variation of the species as it relates to this microhabitat variation; these two types of measurements can generate what is termed a ‘physiological landscape’ for the species. Mapping the micro-scale physiological landscape across space and time, rather than relying on large-scale averages of temperature and means of thermal limits in a species, can allow more accurate estimates of an organism's sensitivity to temperature change and support development of more refined models of the impacts of anthropogenic climate change that have higher predictive power. We thus continually monitored the body (operative) temperature of the intertidal mussel Mytilisepta virgata in both sun-exposed and shaded microhabitats and determined the seasonal variations of cardiac performance of field-acclimatized and laboratory-acclimated mussels from different microhabitats for calculating the thermal sensitivity, as indicated by the difference between the maximum ambient temperature and an individual's upper thermal limit (thermal safety margin, TSM), in each microhabitat and each month. The mussels experienced divergent thermal stress, in average temperature, acute and chronic thermal stress and thermal predictivity among different microhabitats, and presented high spatial–temporal variations of cardiac function as results of seasonal acclimatization and inter-individual variations. Results of TSMs indicated that the thermal sensitivities of the mussels to high temperature were season- and microhabitat specific, and the mussels in the shaded microhabitats were predicted to survive the hottest summer temperatures; however, some individuals in the sun-exposed microhabitats experienced temperatures above their sublethal temperature. With the large, high-resolution dataset of thermal environmental characteristics and the cardiac performances with high variations, we were able to integrate the effects of synchronized changes in microenvironmental temperatures and cardiac thermal responses and thereby characterize the physiological landscape of thermal sensitivity. The complex physiological landscape that exists in the intertidal zone must be taken into account when predicting the effects of changes in environmental temperature, such as those occurring with global climate change.

Marine and atmospheric heatwaves are predicted to impact sessile intertidal marine organisms, especially when exposed at low tide and unable to seek refuge. The study aimed to determine whether a simulated atmospheric heatwave will alter the survival of selectively bred families of Sydney rock oysters (Saccostrea glomerata), and whether survival is dependent on morphological and physiological traits. The survival of S. glomerata families to a simulated atmospheric heatwave varied from 25 to 60\% and was not correlated with morphology or physiology. Survival may depend on the presence of genotypes that translate into molecular defenses such as heat-shock proteins and inhibitor of apoptosis proteins that provide oysters with resilience. Understanding the responses among families of oysters to heatwaves is critical if we are to restore the ecological services of oyster reefs and sustain oyster aquaculture.},

To better understand the scales at which thermal stress impacts organisms, we used biomimetic temperature loggers (robobarnacles) to measure latitudinal variation in estimated barnacle body temperatures (Tetraclita spp.) and evaluated the influences of large, geographic, and smaller scale, microhabitat variation on temperatures experienced. Robobarnacles were deployed at nine sites along the West Pacific and South China Sea coast (five sites in Taiwan, three in Hong Kong and one in Thailand, spanning 13–25°N) from May to September 2013. Estimated body temperatures did not follow a latitudinal gradient; instead, they revealed a mosaic of hot (e.g., NE Taiwan and Thailand) and cooler sites (e.g., two sites in Hong Kong). The hot sites were characterized by frequent occurrences of “heat stress” events (estimated body temperatures ≥40°C for ≥2 h which would result in ≥50\% Tetraclita entering coma). There was a correlation between hourly air temperatures and robo-temperatures, suggesting that air temperature together with solar radiation and thermal radiation re-emitted by the rocky substrate drove the observed spatial robo-temperature variation. Air temperature mediated by solar radiation and rock thermal radiation are, therefore, important contributors affecting the body temperature of sessile intertidal species in the tropical and subtropical W Pacific and South China Sea and can be a good predictor for body temperature and thermal stress of intertidal barnacles.},

Yet an enormous fraction of Earth's taxa live exclusively in habitats where foundation species modify temperatures. We examine little-explored implications of this widespread trend using a classic model system for understanding heat stresses – rocky intertidal shores. Through integrated field measurements and laboratory trials, we demonstrate that thermal buffering by centimetre-thick mussel and seaweed beds eliminates differences in stress-inducing high temperatures and associated mortality risk that would otherwise arise over 14° of latitude and 1 m of shore elevation. These results reveal the extent to which physical effects of habitat-formers can overwhelm broad-scale thermal trends, suggesting a need to re-evaluate climate change predictions for many species. Notably, inhabitant populations may exhibit deceptive resilience to warming until refuge-forming taxa become imperiled.},

However, accurate prediction of the population-scale consequences of extreme thermal events requires detailed knowledge of the small-scale interaction between individual organisms and their thermal environment. In this study I propose a simple model that allows one to explore how individual-to-individual variation in body temperature and thermal physiology determines what fraction of a population will be killed by an extreme thermal event. The model takes into account the possibility that each individual plant or animal can respond to an event by adjusting its thermal tolerance in proportion to the stress it encounters. When thermal stress is relatively mild, the model shows that a graded physiological response of this sort leads to increased survivorship. However, the model predicts that in more severe events a proportional induced defense can actually reduce survivorship, a counterintuitive possibility that is not predicted by standard theory. The model can easily be tailored to different species and thermal environments to provide an estimate of when, where and how physiology can buffer the effects of climate warming.},

We clarify conceptually and through examples from marine and terrestrial environments how facilitation can expand species’ niches and consider how these interactions can be scaled up to understand the importance of facilitation in setting a species’ geographic range. We then integrate the niche-broadening influence of facilitation into current conceptual areas in ecology, including climate change, diversity maintenance and the relationship between diversity and ecosystem functioning. Because facilitation can influence the range of physical conditions under which a species can persist, it has the potential to mitigate the effects of climate change on species distributions. Whereas facilitation has mostly been considered as a diversity-promoting interaction by ameliorating abiotic stresses, if facilitated species’ niches expand and become less distinct as a result of habitat amelioration, the forces that maintain diversity and promote coexistence in regions or habitats dominated by the facilitator could be reduced (i.e. the sign of the effects of facilitation on populations could be species-specific). Finally, shifting or broadening ecological niches could alter the relationship between diversity and ecosystem functioning. A niche-based perspective on the effects of facilitation can foster a greater mechanistic understanding of the role played by facilitation in regulating species coexistence, range shifts and ecosystem functioning in a changing world.},

We developed biomimetic physical models of 3 common northeastern Pacific intertidal species: 2 predatory dogwhelks, Nucella ostrina and N. lamellosa and their barnacle prey, Balanus glandula. We established 42 biomimetics in up to 11 different microhabitats within an approximately 100 m2 region of the shoreline on San Juan Island, Washington, USA. Average temperatures were recorded at 15 min intervals over 3 successive summers. We found large differences in temperatures of N. ostrina biomimetics when placed in different microhabitats; as much as 8°C difference in mean daily maximum temperature and over 30 °C differences on individual days. Solar refuges and differing solar aspects reduced body temperatures, relative to more sun-exposed locations at the same shore height, by as much as moving 0.5 m lower on the shore. When biomimetics of the 3 species were placed in the same habitat, average daily maximum temperatures differed by {\textless} 0.2°C, a surprisingly small amount. Yet because these species differ greatly in known thermal tolerances, the temperatures imply large differences among species in daily risk of thermal stress (0 to 33.8\%). Further, N. ostrina could halve its risk of thermal stress on the high shore by moving between solar aspects. The ability of mobile predators such as Nucella spp. to exploit spatio-temporal variation in temperature likely influences their ability to regulate sessile prey such as B. glandula.},

When exposed to desiccation or predators for 4 to 5 h, mortality of hatchlings located in these microhabitats (1.7to 36\% mortality) was considerably lower than for individuals on open surfaces (99 to 100\%). Also, food (prey species) in C. columbiana, mussel clusters, and S. cariosus microhab{\textasciitilde}tatswas more abundant but of similar energetic value to that on open rock surfaces. The microhabitats used by early juvenile N. emarginata thus provide the double advantage of a considerably reduced risk of mortality and abundant prey. The means by which hatchlings disperse after emerging from their egg capsules were established by laboratory observations and by deployment of collectors in the field. Hatchlings do not actively initiate dispersal by drifting in the water column. Crawling is the usual means of travelling from the capsule to protective microhabitats, with hatchling crawling speed averaging only 3.7 mm min-' on smooth rock surfaces in the laboratory. The abundance and distribution of microhabitats that protect early juveniles could therefore be important determinants of the local abundance and distribution of N. emarginata populations. The use of protective microhabitats may be the key to survival through the vulnerable early juvenile period in many benthic marine organisms.},

	abstract = {Intertidal macroalgae can create or modify habitats, potentially influencing ecosystem dynamics by altering the abundance and distribution of species within their community. However, the engineering ability of these organisms and the relative importance of their bioengineering potential may change rapidly in response to environmental stress. To better understand how bioengineering might influence macroinvertebrate community composition, several scenarios were assessed. First, we evaluated the effect of different macroalgal assemblages composed of single-species cultures at different densities on the attenuation of temperature, irradiance and water loss. Subsequently, we assessed the effect that these modifications had on the abundance and distribution of macroinvertebrates. Results showed that intertidal macroalgae differentially ameliorated physical factors depending on the composition of macroalgal aggregations and the level of environmental stress. Higher macroalgal densities attenuated physical factors the most during daytime low tides, modulated by macroalgal species composition. Moreover, macroalgal species composition was found to influence the community composition of macroinvertebrates under certain environmental baseline conditions. During the day, invertebrates were abundant underneath high-density canopies, regardless of the macroalgal species. At night, however, invertebrates showed specificity towards particular macroalgal species and densities. Bioengineers can influence the strength and nature of interspecific interactions in a variety of ways. Here, the differences in the abundance and distribution of macroinvertebrates associated with macroalgae show that the presence or absence of a bioengineer can result in completely different outcomes for associated organisms (feeding vs. shelter), which may, in turn, have feedback implications at many trophic and spatial scales in the intertidal ecosystem.},

We monitored the succession of species composition of 30 twin grassland communities with identical biotic and abiotic starting conditions in an initially sown diversity gradient between 1 and 16 species over 13 years. The stochasticity of succession, measured as the synchrony in the development of the species compositions of the twin plots, was strongly altered by the extreme warm and dry summer of 2003. Moreover, it was independent from past and present plant diversity and neighbourhood species compositions. Extreme climatic events can induce stochastic effects in community development and therefore impair predictability even under homogeneous abiotic conditions. Stochastic events may result in lasting shifts of community composition, as well as adverse and unforeseeable effects on the stability of ecological services.},

	abstract = {Recent studies suggest that animals are decreasing in size as a general response to global warming, for reasons that remain unclear. Here, by analysing ectotherm death time curves that take into consideration the intensity and duration of a thermal challenge, we show that heat tolerance varies predictably with size. Smaller animals can maintain higher body temperatures than larger ones during short periods, but cannot maintain higher body temperatures over long periods as their endurance declines more rapidly with time. Body size effects and adaptive variation in heat tolerance may have been obscured in the past by these unaccounted for temporal effects. With increasing size, thermal death occurs at relatively lower metabolic rates with respect to rest at a non-stressful temperature, which might partly explain the reported reductions in organism size with climate warming and shed light on the mechanisms that underlie scaling.
Analysis of ectotherm thermal death curves in the context of both challenge intensity and duration shows that smaller animals exhibit higher tolerance to acute stress, but lower tolerance to chronic stress. The size-dependent impact provides one explanation for warming-related reductions in animal size.},

Since 2013, coral cover throughout the region has declined to historically low levels at four of five subregions, with impaired recovery occurring at two subregions. Observations are consistent with global trends of repeated severe heat waves, coral bleaching and acute declines in coral cover. Locations within this study region have already experienced multiple coral-bleaching events within a period of less than 5 years. There is a high likelihood that reefs in the western Pilbara and northern Ningaloo regions will experience more frequent marine heatwaves, coral bleaching and mortality events in the future. Action, therefore, needs to be taken now to support the resilience of coral reef ecosystems in the region, which is arguably the most important coral-reef province on Australia’s western coast.},

	abstract = {To elucidate the determinants of intertidal invertebrate body temperatures during aerial exposure, I developed deterministic models using the environmental inputs of solar radiation, air temperature, ground temperature, and wind speed to predict the body temperatures of intertidal mussels (Mytilus spp.). Combined with field studies, these models were used to determine the effects of body size on body temperature, and to compare the heat budgets of mussels living as solitary individuals vs. those living in aggregations (beds). On average, the model accurately predicted the body temperatures of solitary mussels in the field to within ∼1⚬C. Steady-state simulations (using constant environmental conditions) predicted that, under conditions where evaporative water loss is limited, smaller (5 cm) mussels experience lower body temperatures than larger (10 cm) mussels exposed to identical environmental parameters. When evaporative cooling is limited only by intolerance to desiccation, the trend in body size reversed due to a disproportionately greater amount of tissue (per unit length) in larger mussels, which provides them with a greater reservoir of water available for evaporative cooling. In both scenarios, larger mussels display a greater "thermal inertia" (time constant of change), which buffers them against rapid changes in environmental conditions. No one environmental factor controls body temperature, and thus measurements of single environmental parameters such as air temperature are very unlikely to serve as accurate indicators of mussel body temperature. Results of unsteady simulations (using fluctuating environmental conditions) further indicated a significant effect of the spectral characteristics of the physical environment on body temperature. In many cases predictions of body temperature based only on daily means or extremes of environmental parameters are off by 6⚬C or more due to the time dependence of the system. Models of body temperature must therefore be based upon repeated measurements of multiple environmental parameters, rather than simple statistical measures such as daily mean, maximum, or range. Significantly, several parameters in the model presented here are modified by the proximity of neighboring organisms, including predators and competitors. During extreme environmental conditions (using steady-state conditions), mussels living in beds are predicted to experience substantially lower (4⚬-5⚬C) body temperatures than those living in gaps. Furthermore, living within an aggregation also augments a mussel's thermal inertia, which dampens the effects of rapid temporal changes in the physical environment. In contrast to most previous studies in rocky intertidal habitats, results thus suggest that "physical factors" are not immutable boundaries imposed by the environment, but may be significantly altered by the organism itself through its size, morphology, and interactions with neighbors, which may create feedback loops between abiotic and biotic controls.},

	abstract = {Increases in global temperatures are expected to have dramatic effects on the abundance and distribution of species in the coming years. Intertidal organisms, which already experience temperatures at or beyond their thermal limits, provide a model system in which to investigate these effects. We took advantage of a previous study in which experimental plates were deployed in the intertidal zone and passively warmed for 12 years to a daily maximum temperature on average 2.7°C higher than control plots on the adjacent bedrock. We compared the composition of the biological communities on each experimental plate with its neighboring bedrock control. Plate communities showed decreased richness of taxa and percent cover of filamentous algae, mussels and mobile grazers relative to bedrock, and increased percent cover of biofilm. We then used short-term time-series measurements of plate and bedrock temperatures and a mechanistic heat-budget model to hindcast those temperatures back 12 years. Greater differences in long-term average temperature between the experimental plates and bedrock controls were correlated with lower similarity in community composition. Additionally, years with higher average differences between plate and bedrock temperatures were more predictive of current compositional similarity between plate and bedrock communities, even though they occurred farther in the past than did more recent, but cooler, years. We conclude that current intertidal communities reflect their long-term, rather than short-term, thermal histories. Mechanistic heat-budget models based on short-term measurements can provide this valuable, long-term information.},

	abstract = {Abstract Despite their adverse impacts, definitions and measurements of heat waves are ambiguous and inconsistent, generally being endemic to only the group affected, or the respective study reporting the analysis. The present study addresses this issue by employing a set of three heat wave definitions, derived from surveying heat-related indices in the climate science literature. The definitions include three or more consecutive days above one of the following: the 90th percentile for maximum temperature, the 90th percentile for minimum temperature, and positive extreme heat factor (EHF) conditions. Additionally, each index is studied using a multiaspect framework measuring heat wave number, duration, participating days, and the peak and mean magnitudes. Observed climatologies and trends computed by Sen's Kendall slope estimator are presented for the Australian continent for two time periods (1951–2008 and 1971–2008). Trends in all aspects and definitions are smaller in magnitude but more significant for 1951–2008 than for 1971–2008. Considerable similarities exist in trends of the yearly number of days participating in a heat wave and yearly heat wave frequency, suggesting that the number of available heat wave days drives the number of events. Larger trends in the hottest part of a heat wave suggest that heat wave intensity is increasing faster than the mean magnitude. Although the direct results of this study cannot be inferred for other regions, the methodology has been designed as such that it is widely applicable. Furthermore, it includes a range of definitions that may be useful for a wide range of systems impacted by heat waves.},

Here, we couple fine-grained climate projections (2050–2059) to thermal performance data from 38 ectothermic invertebrate species and contrast projections with those of a simple model. We show that projections based on mean temperature change alone differ substantially from those incorporating changes to the variation, and to the mean and variation in concert. Although most species show increases in performance at greater mean temperatures, the effect of mean and variance change together yields a range of responses, with temperate species at greatest risk of performance declines.

Higher temperatures result in smaller body sizes and associated decreases in metabolic rates, and it remains unknown whether this indirect effect of temperature increase could mitigate the direct positive effect of temperature on metabolic rate. Here, we assess whether temperature-induced shifts in body size are likely to offset the direct influence of temperature on metabolic rate. Location Global. Time period 1940–2011. Major taxa studied Ectotherms. Methods We compiled literature-derived data on mass and temperature for 109 ectotherm species raised at various constant temperatures. Using an allometric equation to estimate metabolic rate from size and temperature, we determined the body masses necessary for species to maintain constant metabolic rates under increased temperatures. We also calculated and compared (a) change in metabolic rate attributable to increased temperature where body size does not change with (b) change in metabolic rate including empirical size change. Results Warmer temperatures resulted in increased metabolic rate estimates, but this was partly offset by decreased body sizes for the majority of species. For most species, observed decreases in body size at higher temperatures were insufficient to avoid metabolic rate increases. Main conclusions Although the indirect effect of temperature on metabolic rate via body size is not sufficient to counterbalance the direct effect, it limits the magnitude of the increase in metabolic rate. Thus, in a warming climate, ectotherms are likely to experience increases in energy use that are smaller than anticipated. Given that metabolic rates have substantial, diverse impacts on individuals, populations, and ecosystems, these indirect effects of temperature change will have complex cascading effects on ecological communities, but the impacts of increases in metabolic rate of these varying magnitudes are unknown.},

While a focus on impacts from mean, long-term changes in climate is warranted, the vast majority of conservation plans largely ignore another key factor of climate change—changes in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather and climate events. A typology of the full range and severity of ecological responses to extreme events would help underpin tracking of their impacts. Location:Global. Methods:Here, we review 519 observational studies of ecological responses to extreme events between 1941 and 2015. We include responses from amphibians, birds, fish, invertebrates, mammals, plants and reptiles to cyclones, drought, flood, cold waves and heat waves. Results:Negative ecological responses were the most commonly reported, accounting for 57\% of all documented responses. There were over 100 cases of a {\textgreater}25\% population decline and 31 cases of local extirpation. Sixty per cent of the studies in our review observed ecological responses for more than 1 year, and of the studies that monitored species or ecosystem recovery following exposure to an extreme event, 38\% showed species or ecosystems did not recover to pre-disturbance levels. Main conclusions:Extreme weather and climate events have profound implications for species and ecosystem management. We discuss current conceptual challenges associated with incorporating extreme events into conservation planning efforts, which include how to quantify species sensitivity and adaptive capacity to extreme events, how to account for interactions between extreme events and other stressors, and how to maximize adaptive capacity to more frequent and intense extreme events.},

The intertidal snail Nucella ostrina risks aerial exposure at low tide to feed on the barnacle Balanus glandula. We hypothesized that N. ostrina foraging behavior would be constrained by duration and timing of low tide exposure. We added snails to intertidal blocks on San Juan Island, Washington, USA, and forced them to choose between barnacles placed on the western or eastern face of each block, or to shelter and forgo foraging. Snail behavior and barnacle mortality were monitored daily for 8 wk during summer 2011. N. ostrina foraging peaked every 2 wk, when temperature was minimized by tidal cycling. Low tide timing determined which substrate orientation was coolest and coincided with the proportion of snails foraging on one substrate face or the other: snails foraged on the western faces on days with morning low tides and on eastern faces on days with afternoon low tides. Barnacle consumption rates mirrored this spatiotemporal foraging pattern. Our conceptual model predicted mobile organism presence and location: snails foraged during the days of the tidal cycle least likely to be hot and selected the coolest available surface when foraging. These results suggest that N. ostrina alters foraging behavior to minimize risk of exposure to high temperatures or other emersion stresses. Consequently, predation on barnacles varies over space and time. This spatiotemporal behavior may buffer warming air temperatures and should be considered in models of coastal population and community dynamics.},

Extreme temperatures are increasingly seen as important influences on biological systems, yet a consistent definition of MHWs does not exist. A clear definition will facilitate retrospective comparisons between MHWs, enabling the synthesis and a mechanistic understanding of the role of MHWs in marine ecosystems. Building on research into atmospheric heatwaves, we propose both a general and specific definition for MHWs, based on a hierarchy of metrics that allow for different data sets to be used in identifying MHWs. We generally define a MHW as a prolonged discrete anomalously warm water event that can be described by its duration, intensity, rate of evolution, and spatial extent. Specifically, we consider an anomalously warm event to be a MHW if it lasts for five or more days, with temperatures warmer than the 90th percentile based on a 30-year historical baseline period. This structure provides flexibility with regard to the description of MHWs and transparency in communicating MHWs to a general audience. The use of these metrics is illustrated for three 21st century MHWs; the northern Mediterranean event in 2003, the Western Australia ‘Ningaloo Niño’ in 2011, and the northwest Atlantic event in 2012. We recommend a specific quantitative definition for MHWs to facilitate global comparisons and to advance our understanding of these phenomena.},

Major taxa studied Amphibians, arthropods, brachiopods, cnidarians, echinoderms, fishes, molluscs, reptiles. Methods We draw together new and existing data quantifying the warm acclimation response in 319 species as the acclimation response ratio (ARR): the increase in upper thermal limit per degree increase in experimental temperature. We develop worst-case scenario climate projections to calculate the number of years and generations gained by ARR until loss of thermal safety. We further compute a vulnerability score that integrates across variables estimating exposure to climate change and species-specific tolerance through traits, including physiological plasticity, generation time and latitudinal range extent. Results ARR is highly variable, but with marked differences across taxa, habitats and latitude. Polar terrestrial arthropods show high ARRs [95\% upper confidence limit (UCL95\%) = 0.68], as do some polar aquatic invertebrates that were acclimated for extended durations (ARR {\textgreater} 0.4). While this physiological plasticity buys 100s of years until thermal safety is lost, combination with long generation times leads to decreased potential for evolutionary adaptation. Additionally, 27\% of marine polar invertebrates have no capacity for acclimation and reptiles and amphibians have minimal ARR (UCL95\% = 0.16). Low physiological plasticity, long generations times and restricted latitudinal ranges combine to distinguish reptiles, amphibians and polar invertebrates as being highly vulnerable amongst ectotherms. Main conclusions In some taxa the combined effects of acclimation capacity and generation time can provide 100s of years and generations before thermal safety is lost. The accuracy of assessments of vulnerability to climate change will be improved by considering multiple aspects of species’ biology that, in combination may increase persistence under extreme heat events, and increase the probability for evolutionary rescue.},

	abstract = {1 Small-scale distributions of rocky intertidal organisms may be determined in part by temperature and desiccation stress during low tide and the ability of organisms to resist such stresses. Biophysical modelling techniques, coupled with data on the physiological tolerance of organisms can be used to predict the frequency and severity of abiotic stress events. 2 The limpet Lottia gigantea is a major competitor for primary space on rocky shores along the west coast of North America. The goal of this study was to quantify the thermal and desiccation tolerance of this species and to predict the frequency of stressful events at Hopkins Marine Station (HMS) in Pacific Grove, CA, USA. 3 Lottia gigantea were exposed to thermal stress regimes in the laboratory using protocols designed to mimic prolonged exposures in the field. The production of heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) was measured as an indicator of sub-lethal stress, and mortality rates were measured. 4 Peak expression of Hsp70 occurred during exposures at 32 °C, while the lethal limits of the limpets ranged between 30 and 42 °C, depending on the exposure regime. Lethal temperatures were approximately 5 °C lower in 50–60\% relative humidity conditions compared to 100\% relative humidity trials. 5 Results from the physiology experiments were compared to field surveys of the upper limits of L. gigantea at HMS and with heat-budget model predictions of limpet body temperatures on a variety of substratum orientations. 6 The highest frequency of sub-lethal and lethal stress events was predicted to occur on high-shore westerly and southerly slopes and horizontal surfaces, microhabitats where L. gigantea is comparatively rare at HMS. Predicted stress and mortality events were rare at low-shore sites, vertical surfaces, and sloping rock faces oriented towards the northeast and northwest. 7 The combination of direct measurements of sub-lethal and lethal temperature thresholds using realistic stress exposures and predictions from a heat-budget model give insight into the role of thermal disturbance in affecting the local-scale distributions of intertidal organisms. These methods hold great promise for enhancing our understanding of the role of abiotic factors in limiting species distributions and making predictions about responses to future climatic conditions.},

	abstract = {Native habitat-forming species can facilitate invasion by reducing environmental stress or consumer pressure. However, the intensity of one stressor along a local gradient may differ when expanding the scale of observation to encompass major variations in background environmental conditions. In this study, we determined how facilitation of the invasive porcelain crab, Petrolisthes elongatus, by the native tube-forming serpulid, Galeolaria caespitosa, varied with environmental gradients at local (tidal height) and larger (wave exposure) spatial scales. G. caespitosa constructs a complex calcareous matrix on the underside of intertidal boulders and we predicted that its positive effects on P. elongatus density would increase in intensity with shore height and be stronger at wave-sheltered than wave-exposed locations. To test these predictions, we conducted two experiments. First, we determined the effects of serpulid presence (boulders with live or dead serpulid matrix vs. bare boulders) at six shore heights that covered the intertidal distribution of P. elongatus. Second, we determined the effects of serpulid presence (present vs. absent), shore height (high vs. low) and wave exposure (sheltered vs. exposed) on crabs across six locations within the invaded range in northern Tasmania, Australia. In Experiment 1, the presence of serpulids (either dead or alive) enhanced P. elongatus densities at all shore heights, with facilitation intensity (as determined by a relative interaction index; RII) tending to increase with shore height. In Experiment 2, serpulids facilitated P. elongatus across shore heights and wave exposures, although crab densities were lower at high shore levels of wave-sheltered locations. However, the intensity of crab facilitation by serpulids was greater on wave-sheltered than on wave-exposed shores, but only at the high shore level. This study demonstrates that local effects of native habitat-formers on invasive species are dependent on prevailing environmental conditions at larger spatial scales and that, under more stressful conditions, invaders become increasingly reliant on positive interactions with native habitat-formers. Increased strength of local-scale facilitation by native species, dampening broader scale variations in environmental stressors, could enhance the ability of invasive species to establish self-sustaining populations in the invaded range.},

Less studied is whether introduced species, particularly those that are important as facilitators in their native range, have persistent positive effects in their invaded range despite a lack of a shared evolutionary history with the invaded community. Here, we manipulated the density of a habitat-forming facilitator, the high intertidal acorn barnacle Balanus glandula, factorially with herbivore density in its native range (Bluestone Point, British Columbia, Canada) and invaded range (Punta Ameghino, Chubut Province, Argentina) to determine how this facilitator differentially affects associated species at these two locations. Given that high intertidal species at Punta Ameghino (PA) are evolutionarily naïve to barnacles, we predicted that the positive effects of B. glandula at PA would be absent or weak compared to those at Bluestone Point (BP). However, we found that B. glandula had an equally positive effect on herbivore biomass at PA compared to BP, possibly because the moisture-retaining properties of barnacle bed habitats are particularly important in seasonally dry Patagonia. Barnacle presence indirectly decreased ephemeral algal cover at BP by increasing grazer pressure, but barnacles instead facilitated ephemeral algae at PA. In contrast, B. glandula increased perennial algal cover at BP, but generally decreased perennial algal cover at PA, likely due to differences in dominant algal morphology. Though our experiment was limited to one location on each continent, our results suggest that shared evolutionary history may not be a prerequisite for strong facilitation to occur, but rather that the nature and strength of novel species interactions are determined by the traits of associated species and the environment in which they occur.},

Traditionally, ecological studies of warming events focused on maximum temperatures and duration, rather than the rate of warming at the onset. Here, we show that onsets can trigger widespread mortality of reef fish. Hundreds of thermally stressed fish, belonging to dozens of species, became fatally infected with a common pathogen in the Red Sea. Differential susceptibility led to selective mortality, with disproportional death among predators and benthic feeders. A reassessment of past reports suggests that extreme onset might have been an overlooked trigger of fish kills elsewhere. Warming tropical and subtropical reefs may face an increasing frequency of extreme onsets, eliciting calamities far beyond coral bleaching., Our study reveals a hitherto overlooked ecological threat of climate change. Studies of warming events in the ocean have typically focused on the events’ maximum temperature and duration as the cause of devastating disturbances in coral reefs, kelp forests, and rocky shores. In this study, however, we found that the rate of onset (Ronset), rather than the peak, was the likely trigger of mass mortality of coral reef fishes in the Red Sea. Following a steep rise in water temperature (4.2 °C in 2.5 d), thermally stressed fish belonging to dozens of species became fatally infected by Streptococcus iniae. Piscivores and benthivores were disproportionately impacted whereas zooplanktivores were spared. Mortality rates peaked 2 wk later, coinciding with a second warming event with extreme Ronset. The epizootic lasted ∼2 mo, extending beyond the warming events through the consumption of pathogen-laden carcasses by uninfected fish. The warming was widespread, with an evident decline in wind speed, barometric pressure, and latent heat flux. A reassessment of past reports suggests that steep Ronset was also the probable trigger of mass mortalities of wild fish elsewhere. If the ongoing increase in the frequency and intensity of marine heat waves is associated with a corresponding increase in the frequency of extreme Ronset, calamities inflicted on coral reefs by the warming oceans may extend far beyond coral bleaching.},

These “marine heatwaves” (MHWs) have been linked to changes in primary productivity, community composition and biogeography of seaweeds, which often control ecosystem function and services. Here we review the literature on seaweed responses to MHWs, including 58 observations related to resistance, bleaching, changes in abundance, species invasions and local to regional extinctions. More records existed for canopy-forming kelps and bladed and filamentous turf-forming seaweeds than for canopy-forming fucoids, geniculate coralline turf and crustose coralline algae. Turf-forming seaweeds, especially invasive seaweeds, generally increased in abundance after a MHW, whereas native canopy-forming kelps and fucoids typically declined in abundance. We also found four examples of regional extinctions of kelp and fucoids following specific MHWs, events that likely have long term consequences for ecological structure and functioning. Although a relatively small number of studies have described impacts of MHWs on seaweed, the broad range of documented responses highlights the necessity of better baseline information regarding seaweed distributions and performance, and the need to study specific characteristics of MHWs that affect the vulnerability and resilience of seaweeds to these increasingly important climatic perturbations. A major challenge will be to disentangle impacts caused by the extreme temperature increases of MHWs itself from co-occurring potential stressors including altered current patterns, increasing herbivory, changes in water clarity and nutrient content, solar radiation and desiccation stress in the intertidal zone. With future increases anticipated in the intensity, duration and frequencies of MHWs, we expect to see more replacements of large long-lived habitat forming seaweeds with smaller ephemeral seaweeds, reducing the habitat structure and effective services seaweed-dominated reefs can provide.},

We examined intertidal mussel beds at four distant locations around the globe with the same sampling method, to find out whether this “hot spot” designation holds universally. We studied species assemblages within the matrices of byssally interconnected mussels engineered by Mytilus edulis in the North Sea, by mixed Perumytilus purpuratus and Mytilus chilensis at the southern Chilean coast, by Musculista senhousia in the Yellow Sea and by Xenostrobusinconstans at the coast of southern Australia. In all cases, species assemblages inside mussel beds were significantly different from those outside with many species being restricted to one habitat type. However, species richness and diversity were not generally higher in mussel beds than in ambient sediments without mussels. In the North Sea (M. edulis) and at the Chilean coast (P. purpuratus, M. chilensis), mussel beds have markedly higher species numbers and diversities than surrounding sediments, but this was not the case for mussel beds in Australia (X. inconstans) and the Yellow Sea (M. senhousia) where numbers of associated species were only slightly higher and somewhat lower than in adjacent sediments, respectively. In conclusion, although soft bottom mytilid mussels generally enhance habitat heterogeneity and species diversity at the ecosystem level, mussel beds themselves are not universal centres of biodiversity, but the effects on associated species are site specific.},

	abstract = {Marine rocky intertidal organisms are amongst those most affected by climate change with regional distribu­ tional changes observed for many species. Although often ascribed to increased sea surface temperatures, precise assessment of the local habitat conditions underpinning observed and predicted changes in community assembly is lacking. Here we examine how aspect (i.e. north-south orientation) affects intertidal community composition and how rock surface temperatures and stress responses of two dominant grazer species (Patella spp.) elucidate emergent differences. We quantified year-round temperature variation and surveyed intertidal community composition on paired natural rock gullies with Equator- (EF) and Pole-facing (PF) surfaces. We also investigated variation in limpet (Patella spp.) reproductive phenology and osmotic stress. Average annual temperatures were 0.8 ◦C (1.6 ◦C at low tide) higher, with six-fold more frequent extremes (i.e. {\textgreater} 30 ◦C) on EF than PF surfaces. Intertidal community composition varied with aspect across trophic levels with greater overall species richness, abundance of primary producers and grazers on PF-surfaces, and greater barnacle abundance on EF-surfaces. Although species richness of organisms from different biogeographical origins (‘Boreal’ or ‘Lusitanian’) did not vary, the Lusitanian limpet Patella depressa exhibited earlier reproductive development on EF-surfaces and both limpet species exhibited greater thermal stress on EF-surfaces. We argue that our study system provides a good model for understanding how temperature variation at local scales can affect community composition, as well as ecophysiological and ecological responses to climate change and so better inform and predict regional range shifts over coming decades.},

	abstract = {How species interactions vary as a function of habitat characteristics continues to be an important debate in ecology. Using the barnacle-seaweed assemblage common in New England rocky intertidal habitats, I tested the hypothesis that species interactions switch from negative to positive at sites across the Cape Cod faunal barrier because of latitudinal variation in thermal stress and predation intensity between these regions. I manipulated Ascophyllum nodosum canopies in the high zone of two sites from each region and then determined the consequences for underlying Semibalanus balanoides recruits and adults for two years (January 1995 through January 1997). In both years, algal canopies reduced barnacle recruitment and growth rates at all sites but greatly increased survival rates only at the southern sites. When integrated in a demographic framework, these data showed that the reproductive fitness potential of individuals was facilitated by the algal canopy at southern sites but was reduced under similar conditions at northern sites. At southern sites, this was likely the result of buffering from physical stresses in the absence of predators. At northern sites, any buffering from physical stress was likely offset by an increase in mortality in the presence of predators. Interestingly, this variability in species interactions appeared to be associated with subtle variation in climate. Facilitation was evident only during 1995, the warmest year on record since 1900. In contrast, interactions were entirely negative during 1996, a slightly cooler year. These results suggest that species interactions in the intertidal zone may be sensitive to even subtle changes in climate. Interspecific buffering of neighbors from thermal stress is likely to be common in other systems and suggests that both aquatic and terrestrial vegetation may become increasingly important to local species persistence as climates change during the next century.},

	abstract = {In rocky intertidal habitats, abiotic stress due to desiccation and thermal extremes increases with elevation because of tides. A study in Atlantic Canada showed that, at low elevations where conditions are benign due to the brief low tides, fucoid algal canopies (Ascophyllum nodosum and Fucus spp.) do not affect the structure of benthic communities. However, at middle and high elevations, where low tides last longer, fucoid canopies limit abiotic extremes and increase the richness (number of invertebrate and algal species, except fucoids) of benthic communities. Using the data from that study, this paper compares the intensity of facilitation and its importance (relative to all other sources of variation in richness) between middle and high elevations, which represent intermediate and high stress, respectively. Facilitation intensity was calculated as the percent increase in benthic richness between quadrats with low and high canopy cover, while the importance of facilitation was calculated as the percentage of variation in richness explained by canopy cover. Data for 689 quadrats spanning 350 km of coastline were used. Both the intensity and importance of facilitation were greater at middle elevations than at high elevations. As canopies do not affect benthic communities at low elevations, this study suggests that the facilitation-stress relationship at the community level is unimodal for this marine system. Such a pattern was found for some terrestrial systems dominated by canopy-forming plants. Thus, it might be ubiquitous in nature and, as further studies refine it, it might help to predict community-level facilitation depending on environmental stress.},

Here we measured seasonal variation in operative environmental temperature (Te), body temperature (Tb), and microhabitat use of endangered crocodile lizards (Shinisaurus crocodilurus) from a captive population, within open and shaded enclosures, to understand how they respond to thermally challenging en­ vironments. Te was higher in open enclosures than in shaded enclosures. The Tb of lizards differed between the open and shaded enclosures in summer and autumn, but not in spring. In summer, crocodile lizards stayed in the water to avoid overheating, whereas in autumn, crocodile lizards perched on branches seeking optimal thermal environments. Crocodile lizards showed higher thermoregulatory effectiveness in open enclosures (with low thermal quality) than in shaded enclosures. Our study suggests that the crocodile lizard is capable of behavioural thermoregulation via microhabitat selection, although overall, it is not an effective thermoregulator. Therefore, maintaining diverse thermal environments in natural habitats for behavioural thermoregulation is an essential measure to conserve this endangered species both in the field and captivity.},

	abstract = {Heat waves, i.e., periods of extremely hot weather, are expected to increase in frequency and duration under climate change. Repeated exposure to thermal stress events such as heat waves can aﬀect population dynamics and even population persistence. Understanding whether recent thermal history bolsters or hinders demographic responses such as survival or growth during heat waves is crucial for predicting population persistence in the face of climate change. We tested for diﬀerential mortality following an experimental heat wave in populations of the splash pool copepod, Tigriopus californicus, inhabiting pools that diﬀer in their recent thermal history. We observed diﬀerences in survivorship that were correlated with diﬀerences in thermal history. Among multiple metrics of thermal history, daily degree-hours (a measure of heat accumulation) best explained heat wave survival such that a higher number of degree-hours resulted in reduced heat wave survival. This ﬁnding is consistent with the hypothesis that repeated exposure to sublethal temperatures reduces thermal tolerance. Increasing heat wave intensity and duration, or warmer conditions that increase heat accumulation followed by heat waves may negatively impact population persistence by exacerbating the demographic eﬀects of heat waves. The results of this study emphasize the need to integrate mechanistic physiology within the realm of population ecology to bolster the ability to predict population-level responses to climate change.},

Recruitment plates were attached to the substrate at each site in all possible treatment combinations, including either presence of absence of macroalgal canopy, presence or absence of the herbivore, and presence or absence of a cage. Signiﬁcant differences in recruitment were observed among sites in April and May, but not in June. The average number of recruits also varied signiﬁcantly among herbivore treatments in May and June, and in the May macroalgae 3 herbivore interaction. Survivorship did not differ among sites, but did vary signiﬁcantly among herbivore treatments. These differences were due almost entirely to consistently low recruitment and survival in the uncaged or open controls. Comparisons of the caged and open treatments explained between 88 and 99\% of the variation in the respective main effects tests. The presence or absence of L. littorea or of macroalgal canopy had little effect on S. balanoides recruitment or survivorship. Results support previous conclusions that recruitment is greater on more exposed shores and suggest that exclusion cages may protect barnacle recruits from factors such as desiccation and the whiplash effect of macroalgal fronds. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

	abstract = {Biogenic structures that persist post-mortem are ubiquitous, but rarely considered as key ecological features. Post-mortem structures in many ecological systems exert community-level effects and thus the dynamics of their degradation (i.e. taphonomy) become important in affecting community functions and ecosystem services, and these often-overlooked effects may rival the influence of recruitment and typical post-recruitment processes. Moreover, in some highly researched habitat types, post-mortem structures may be mistaken for living organisms, thus introducing significant error into our understanding of population processes. We examined widespread patterns and processes in marine assemblages with calcareous tubeworms and brackish-water assemblages with bryozoans, in order to test the importance of taphonomy for populations and communities. In tubeworm assemblages, taphonomic variability caused differential accumulation of post-mortem structures, exerting community-level influence, and importantly it negated effects from recruitment on the community functions. For tubeworms and bryozoans, proportions of post-mortem structures varied between sheltered and exposed habitats with overall distributional variability being caused by the share of post-mortem structures, not living animals. Population-level inferences in such systems would be extremely problematic without careful differentiation of dead/living structures. Dynamics emerging from the interaction of taphonomic processes and recruitment ecology are relevant for many other important biogenic habitats, especially coral reefs with death assemblages of bleached corals; a failure to consider variability in processes acting on the death assemblages, alongside the living, may severely distort understanding of patterns and processes in populations and communities.},

Sunny versus shaded differences were consistently larger than the variability associated with the seasons and with shore level. Moreover, daily variation far exceeded that observed when considering only averaged sea surface temperature.

However, studies of shading have been poorly explored from an environmental impact perspective. We compared community structure on subtropical rocky shores in areas shaded by human constructions with those in unshaded areas. We then implemented a manipulative field experiment to determine the effects of shading on the macrobenthic community, biofilm biomass and larval recruitment. Shading consistently affected the biological community of rocky shores. The biomass and cover of macroalgae and the size of most sedentary grazers were smaller in shaded habitat. In the infralittoral fringe, we recorded a shift in dominance from macroalgae in unshaded habitats to invertebrate filter feeders in shaded ones. In a similar way, the community from the mesolittoral was also affected by shading but not at all locations. Experimental manipulation of shading led to a total loss of macroalgae from the infralittoral fringe and no community replacement over a period of 220 days. In the mesolittoral, oysters became more abundant in shaded conditions, while barnacles decreased in abundance. Larval recruitment was also affected, with oysters and barnacles recruiting more in shaded habitats. Synthesis and applications. We demonstrate a clear impact of shading by artificial human-made structures on patterns and processes regulating biodiversity on rocky shores and thus consequences for coastal ecosystem functioning. We argue that shading by artificial coastal structures, such as those proposed in the port expansion in our study site in south-eastern Brazil, is potentially underestimated. Our work emphasizes the importance of careful evaluations of artificial structures in order to promote sustainable coastal development. As a result, we do not recommend the proposed expansion by suspended structures of the port of São Sebastião, as the consequent shading will negatively affect the biodiversity and ecosystem functioning of the Araçá Bay and surrounding areas.},

In this study, we investigated the direct and indirect effects of temperature on epilithic primary producers (micro- and macroalgae) and an abundant consumer, the rough limpet Lottia scabra, in the rocky intertidal zone in central and northern California, USA. We factorially manipulated temperature and limpet abundance in the field to determine the effects of temperature on herbivore growth and mortality, algal abundance, and the strength of plant–herbivore interactions. Microalgal growth was positively affected by shading at both locations, and negatively affected by limpet grazing at Pacific Grove but not at Bodega Bay. Macroalgae were only abundant at Bodega Bay, where changes in abundance were negatively related to grazing and independent of temperature. Despite temperature-related changes in microalgal food supply, there were no direct or indirect effects of temperature manipulation on L. scabra growth or mortality. Furthermore, temperature did not alter the importance of herbivory at either site. These results indicate that the influence of increasing temperature, as is predicted with climate change, will have differential effects on producers and consumers. However, thermal effects at one trophic level do not necessarily propagate through the food web to other trophic levels.},

	abstract = {The effective use of ecosystem engineers to conserve biodiversity requires an understanding of the types of resources an engineer modifies, and how these modifications vary with biotic and abiotic context. In the intertidal zone, oysters engineer ecological communities by reducing temperature and desiccation stress, enhancing the availability of hard substrate for attachment, and by ameliorating biological interactions such as competition and predation. Using a field experiment manipulating shading, predator access and availability of shell substrate at four sites distributed over 900 km of east Australian coastline, we investigated how the relative importance of these mechanisms of facilitation vary spatially. At all sites, and irrespective of environmental conditions, the provision of hard substrate by oysters enhanced the abundance and richness of invertebrates, in particular epibionts (barnacles and oyster spat) and grazing gastropods. Mobile arthropods utilised the habitat provided by disarticulated dead oysters more than live oyster habitat, whereas the abundance of polychaetes and bivalves were much greater in live oysters, suggesting the oyster filter-feeding activity is important for these groups. In warmer estuaries, shading by oysters had a larger effect on biodiversity, whereas in cooler estuaries, the provision of a predation refuge by oysters played a more important role. Such knowledge of how ecosystem engineering effects vary across environmental gradients can help inform management strategies targeting ecosystem resilience via the amelioration of specific environmental stressors, or conservation of specific community assemblages.},

	abstract = {Species are responding to global climate change in varied and nuanced ways. However, how species-specific responses to climate change= affect interactions among species remains poorly understood. It is important to understand species interactions under potential climate change scenarios because those interactions can in turn alter community dynamics. In this study, we conducted two complementary experiments to examine how simulated warming might alter larval intraguild predation (IGP) rates and resulting adult assemblage composition in three species of North American dragonflies: Pachydiplax longipennis, Plathemis lydia and Libellula luctuosa. First, using both P. longipennis and L. luctuosa, we isolated interspecific and intraspecific pairs of larval dragonflies of different size differentials to determine how the size and species identity might influence IGP rates. In tandem, we conducted a year-long mesocosm experiment with all three species to assess how simulated warming and heat waves influenced the resulting adult dragonfly assemblages. IGP trials revealed that P. longipennis individuals were much more likely to engage in IGP than L. luctuosa, regardless of size differential. In the mesocosm experiment, emerging adult assemblages were dominated by P. longipennis individuals, a pattern that was most pronounced in the control treatment. Our results indicate that while P. longipennis may be the competitively dominant species under current ambient conditions, warming may alter this dynamic and lessen the dominance of this species on the resulting assemblage composition.},

	abstract = {Metabolism provides a basis for using first principles of physics, chemistry, and biology to link the biology of individual organisms to the ecology of populations, communities, and ecosystems. Metabolic rate, the rate at which organisms take up, transform, and expend energy and materials, is the most fundamental biological rate. We have developed a quantitative theory for how metabolic rate varies with body size and temperature. Metabolic theory predicts how metabolic rate, by setting the rates of resource uptake from the environment and resource allocation to survival, growth, and reproduction, controls ecological processes at all levels of organization from individuals to the biosphere. Examples include: (1) life history attributes, including development rate, mortality rate, age at maturity, life span, and population growth rate; (2) population interactions, including carrying capacity, rates of competition and predation, and patterns of species diversity; and (3) ecosystem processes, including rates of biomass production and respiration and patterns of trophic dynamics. Data compiled from the ecological literature strongly support the theoretical predictions. Eventually, metabolic theory may provide a conceptual foundation for much of ecology, just as genetic theory provides a foundation for much of evolutionary biology.},

For scales with a lower and upper bound, a suitable candidate for models is the beta distribution, which is very flexible and models skew quite well. The authors present maximum-likelihood regression models assuming that the dependent variable is conditionally beta distributed rather than Gaussian. The approach models both means (location) and variances (dispersion) with their own distinct sets of predictors (continuous and/or categorical), thereby modeling heteroscedasticity. The location submodel link function is the logit and thereby analogous to logistic regression, whereas the dispersion submodel is log linear. Real examples show that these models handle the independent observations case readily. The article discusses comparisons between beta regression and alternative techniques, model selection and interpretation, practical estimation, and software.
